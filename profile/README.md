# Nipah Code Tools

## What is this?
A project of mine, specifically a code editor that aims to be an relatively lightweight and powerfull editor with IDE ideas on mind

## How it will work?
The idea is to segregate every strong piece of this into specific callable components that then will be used to integrate in one great and modular software.
In other words, this will have for the base:
  - An engine, that will orchestrate all other processes
  - At least one language server to process inputs from user and returns syntax coloring, intellisense and these sort of things
  - (Optional) intelisense-specific servers to handle and generate way better results for autocompletion (they are optional because the language server can do that)
  - An UI process to "render" all the code and handle user inputs, it will be literally the interface or shell in relation with the end-user
  - (UI) And firstly I will make a console-based one
